# JavaScript Learning Hub 🚀

A personal repository of JavaScript materials, snippets, and experiments I've collected throughout my coding journey. This is my digital notebook for all things JavaScript - sometimes messy, always useful.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository contains a variety of JavaScript resources including:

- Code snippets for common patterns and problems
- Notes from courses and tutorials
- Small experimental projects
- Algorithm implementations and practice
- Reference materials and cheat sheets

## 🗂️ Navigation

The repository is a work in progress, and while it's not organized yet, you might find:

- `/game-of-life` - My take on Conway's game of life
- `/frontend-masters` - Frontend masters related materials
- `/quiz` - Javascript quiz materials! I should probably delete answers
- `/patterns` - Exploring common software design patterns

## 🌱 Future Plans

This is primarily a personal learning repository that I plan to organize better in the future:

- Improve folder structure and categorization
- Add more detailed documentation
- Create an index of concepts covered
- Tag content by difficulty and topic


## 🤔 Why This Repository Exists

I created this space to:

- Keep track of my JavaScript learning journey
- Have quick access to code solutions I've worked through
- Store reference materials I find valuable
- Document my progress and growth


## 📝 Note to Self

Future me: Remember to revisit and refactor these materials when you have time. Organization is coming... eventually!
